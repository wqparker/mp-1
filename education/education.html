                            I atteneded Viewpoint School in Calabasas, California since kindergarten, graduating 
                            in May of 2021. I graduated high school with a weighted GPA of 4.63, enrolling and completing
                            nine AP courses that included: AP European History, AP Chemistry, AP Physics I, AP United States
                            History, AP Computer Science A, AP English Language and Composition, AP Physics 2, AP Calculus BC,
                            and AP Psychology. I completed the SAT for my college applications, earning a score of 1510/1600, with 
                            respective scores of ERW: 730 and M: 780 for the sections. In the summer of 2021 I attended a Summer 
                            Programming course at Yale University, having been one of three high school students to be 
                            admitted to the program when I applied. I went on to take a gap year for the 2021/2022 school year,
                            enrolling in Boston University in the fall of 2022. For more information on what I did during
                            this time, please look at my <a href="../employment/employment.html">Employment</a> history.
